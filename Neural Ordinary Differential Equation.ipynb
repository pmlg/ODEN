    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "NeurIPS is the largest AI conference in the world. 4,854 papers were submitted. 4 received \"Best paper\" award. This is one of them. The basic idea is that neural networks are made up of stacked layers of simple computation nodes that work together to approximate a function. If we re-frame a neural network as an \"Ordinary Differential Equation\", we can use existing ODE solvers (like Euler's method) to approximate a function. This means no discrete layers, instead the network is a continous function. No more specifying the # of layers beforehand, instead specify the desired accuracy, it will learn how to train itself within that margin of error. It's still early stages, but this could be as big a breakthrough as GANs! \n",

    "The idea of VAE is to infer $p(z)$ using $p(z|X)$. This is make a lot of sense if we think about it: we want to make our latent variable likely under our data. Talking in term of our fable example, we want to limit our imagination only on animal kingdom domain, so we shouldn’t imagine about things like root, leaf, tyre, glass, GPU, refrigerator, doormat, … as it’s unlikely that those things have anything to do with things that come from the animal kingdom. Right?\n",

    "But the problem is, we have to infer that density  $p(z|X)$, as we don’t know it yet. In VAE, as it name suggests, we infer $p(z|X)$ using a method called Variational Inference (VI). VI is one of the popular choice of method in bayesian inference, the other one being MCMC method. The main idea of VI is to pose the inference by approach it as an optimization problem. How? By modeling the true density $p(z|X)$ using simpler density that is easy to evaluate, e.g. Gaussian, and minimize the difference between those two density using KL divergence metric, which tells us how difference it is $p$ and $q$."
